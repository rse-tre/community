# Project discussion: Would a systematic approach to data risk classification be helpful?

_Chair: Will Crocombe (RISG Consulting)_

## Prompts

- Risk - how much and what sort? Personal/sensitive, commercial, political, IP...
- Why classify risk and how might it help?
- What type and level of controls might be practicable and proportionate?

## Notes

- Could there be a common language around risk?
- Classify based on the ease of identifiability, plus 'payload' - what would we know about them?
- Proportionate controls - Tiered. Gatekeepers and access points (where). E.g.
  - 0 - public
  - 1 - anonymised
  - 2 - strong pseudo
  - 3 - weak pseudo
  - 4 - public
- Dropping down tiers, things become easier. Turing paper on this - Sheffield used this as the basis of their system for assessing risk.

- Doing this work at King's similar classification to Turin paper
- Dundee operate on a blanket tier

- My question was going to be around risk classification, based on my understanding of Goldacre, pseudonymisation should not be relied on. I agree researchers should only be presented data required for their project, but the risk of de-anonymisation particularly when combining datasets means this should be treated cautiously at best.
