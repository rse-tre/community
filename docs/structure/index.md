The community is currently entirely volunteer-driven, with no formally allocated time or resources for anyone.
As the community grows and develops, we may need to think about more robust infrastructure concerning its operation and governance.

Currently, there are two main focuses of the community:

1. Quarterly community events
2. Community Working Groups

## Quarterly Community Events

These started with the inaugural community meeting at RSE Con 22 in September 2022.
Subsequent online meetings have taken place in December 2022, March 2023 and July 2023.

More detail on these events, and their write-ups, can be found in [the events section](../events/index.md)

## Working groups

As well as hosting quarterly events, the community has established 4 working groups to tackle key TRE issues collaboratively.
These working groups are self organised, and aim to make progress on their respective focus areas between community events.

The four working groups are:

- [**Open Source & Open Standards**](./open-source-open-standards.md): Promoting open standards and open source TRE infrastructure
- [**Community Management & Engagement**](./community-management.md): running this group effectively, and engaging all relevant stakeholders
- [**Funding & Sustainability**](./funding-sustainability.md): Exploring funding models and operation models to enable long-term sustainability and realisation of TRE infrastructure
- [**Information Governance**](./information-governance.md): Managing information governance requirements within TRE infrastructure, and moving towards standardisation
